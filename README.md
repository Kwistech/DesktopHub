DesktopHub is split into two sections:

**Main section** - Contains the top four buttons (C:, D:, Docs, and DLs). 
               The button text corresponds to what will open in explorer or a browser when that button is pressed.

**Module(s)** - Optional "plug-ins" for DesktopHub. On the image to the left,
            there are three modules loaded (below the dotted horizontal line)
            in addition to the main section. Each module takes up 1-2 rows in the GUI.
            The modules shown here (top to bottom) are: python_paths.py, google_search.py, 
            and github.py.
            
Note: Modules can be activated and inactivated by moving the module (files in 
      DesktopHub/modules folder with the .py extention) from the modules folder into 
      the inactive modules folder (and visa-versa).
